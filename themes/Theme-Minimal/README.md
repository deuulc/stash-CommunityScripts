# Minimal Theme

I've tried to create a theme that brings content to the front while reducing mental load from UI clutter. It simplifies everythingâ€”less color, fewer distractions, more focus. The goal is clarity: a clean, minimal design that keeps what matters in view.

It's still rough around the edges and very much a work in progress. Feedback is welcome!
